      <h1>Squirtle</h1>
    </p>

    <p><img src="img/pokemon2.png">
      Squirtle is a small Pokémon that resembles a light blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its
      hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge
      between the two halves.
      <p>Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or for sleeping, and its grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance when this Pokémon swims. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with
        great accuracy. In the past, Skull Bash was its signature move. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. The anime has shown that it can be found living on secluded islands with other members of
        its evolutionary line.
      </p>
      <p>In Journey to the Starting Line!, a set of the three Kanto starter Pokémon in which a boy named Gilbert was supposed to choose from as his starting Pokémon were scared off by Ash's Tauros. Professor Oak, Tracey, Delia, and Gilbert had to
        split up and find the three missing Pokémon. Squirtle was the second one found. The Tiny Turtle Pokémon was stuck in a tree that was hanging over a cliff. Ash's Bulbasaur managed to catch the Squirtle before it could fall off the cliff.

        Another Squirtle was seen with Professor Oak in A Six Pack Attack! along with a Bulbasaur and Charmander. Professor Oak showed off yet another Squirtle along with a Bulbasaur and Charmander during the Kanto Fair.
